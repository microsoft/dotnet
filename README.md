# .NET Home

The dotnet repository is the starting point to engage in and learn about .NET
open source projects from [Microsoft](http://microsoft.github.io) and the
[.NET Foundation](http://dotnet.github.io). You can read the more detailed
[.NET Core is Open Source](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx)
on the .NET blog.

## Finding .NET Open Source Projects

There are many [open source .NET projects](dotnet-developer-projects.md). Check
out the [list of projects](dotnet-developer-projects.md) the community
maintains. Please find one to engage in or add one. There's certainly one out
there that could use your help.

There are several projects from Microsoft on GitHub and CodePlex, including:

* [.NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn")](https://roslyn.codeplex.com)
* [.NET Core 5](https://github.com/dotnet/core)
* [ASP.NET 5](https://github.com/aspnet/home)
* [EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework)

Each one of these projects maps to one or more
[.NET NuGet packages](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/p/nugetpackages.aspx)
that are published on [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org/).

There are also many great [open source .NET community projects](dotnet-developer-projects.md), such as:

* [Mono Project](https://github.com/mono/)
* [JSON.NET](http://json.net/)
* [MVVM Cross](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross)
* [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://www.mvvmlight.net)
* [Glimpse](http://getglimpse.com)
* [MonoGame](http://monogame.net)
* [Exceptionless](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless)

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

.NET open source projects from Microsoft (gladly) accept PRs and other
contributions. To contribute to ASP.NET 5 or EntityFramework, see
[the ASP.NET Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
To contribute to .NET Core 5, see the
[.NET Core Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/wiki/Contributing).

You are also encouraged to start a discussion by posting on the
[.NET Foundation Forums](http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/) or filing an issue
in the corresponding GitHub project. See the contributing guides for more
details.

## .NET Foundation

Most .NET open source projects at Microsoft have been contributed to the
[.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects). There are two main
.NET Foundation projects for Microsoft open source projects:
[ASP.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/aspnet-5)
and the [.NET Core 5 project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/netcore5).
